1.Write a program to perform DFS traversal on a 2D plane by taking the user input of grid size N. After
that generate NÃ—N matrix and place the obstacles randomly. Now print the matrix and take user input
of starting and goal state.
2. Write a program to find the path from source to destination using DFS.
3.Write a program to find the topological order of node traversal of the robot on the 2D graph plane.
