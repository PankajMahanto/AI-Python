1. Write a program to perform BFS traversal on a 2D plane by taking the user input of grid size N. After
that generate NÃ—N matrix and place the obstacles randomly. Now print the matrix and take user input
of starting and goal state.
2. Print the required moves throughout the traversal along with the tiles coordinate.
For example -
Moving Down -> (2, 3)
Moving Right -> (2, 4)
...
etc.

3. Write a program where a robot traverses on a 2D plane using the BFS algorithm and goes from start to
destination point. Now print the path it will traverse to reach the destination.
(Hint: Save parent state information and use that information to write a recursive function
for printing the path.)
